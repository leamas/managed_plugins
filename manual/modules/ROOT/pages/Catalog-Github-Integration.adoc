= Automatic Metadata Git Push

Shipdriver-based plugins have experimental support for pushing metadata
to a remote git repository. The goal is to simplify the process for
creating pull requests against
https://github.com/opencpn/plugins[OpenCPN/plugins].

When enabled, all metadata files created when the plugin is built are
replicated to a fork of OpenCPN/plugins set up by the user. This fork
can be used to make a PR against OpenCPN/plugins. In particular, there
is no need to download metadata files from Cloudsmith in order to make a
PR.

== Configuration

Prerequisites:

* A plugin. Here, TideFinder is used as example.
* A fork of
https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins.git[https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins.git]
on Github.

To enable this support which copies metadata from TideFinder to the
OpenCPN/plugins fork:

. Create a branch called _auto_ in the OpenCPN/plugins fork:
* For builds targeting the *master catalog*: drop possible existing auto
branch and create a new on top of master:
+
....
$ git branch -D auto ①
$ git remote update upstream ②
$ git checkout -b auto upstream/master ③
$ git push -f origin auto:auto ④
....
* Builds targeting the *beta catalog* is handled in a similar way:
+
....
$ git branch -D auto ①
$ git remote update upstream ②
$ git checkout -b auto upstream/Beta ③
$ git push -f origin auto:auto ④
....
+
① Remove any existing auto branch, disregard error messages. +
② Make sure our data about the github catalog is updated. +
③ Create a new branch on top of master or Beta +
④ Unconditionally overwrite the github branch

. Run the script _ci/new-credentials_ in the TideFinder repo. The script
will ask for the ssh url to your plugins fork repo and a secret
password. The ssh url, something like \git@github.com:Rasbats/plugins.git, 
can be found in the Github UI:
+
image::github/1.plugins.jpg[1.plugins.jpg]
 
. Dont forget the password...
. The script will create an encrypted private + a public key in the
TideFinder _build-deps_ directory. Commit and push these to Github:
+
....
$ git add build-deps/*.enc build-deps/*.pub
$ git commit -m "Add git deployment key."
$ git push origin master:master
....
. Register the new public key (displayed by new-credentials) as a
deployment key with write permissions (Allow write access) on your
github OpenCPN/plugins fork repo (in Settings | Deploy keys):
+
image:github/10.deploy.key.jpg[10.deploy.key.jpg]
+
After adding the key things should look like:
+
image:github/9.deploy.key.jpg[9.deploy.key.jpg]
+
Note that despite images, the public key is indeed public; there is no
need to keep it secret.

. Set environment variables in all builders like Circleci, drone.io and
Appveyor:
* GIT_KEY_PASSWORD: Password entered to new-credentials.
* GIT_REPO: The ssh-based url to your OpenCPN/plugins clone, the same as
entered to new-credentials.

== During the build

When the builders are run, the git-push part will

* Make a clone of the OpenCPN/plugins fork repository
* Add the new metadata file.
* Commit and push the change to the auto branch in the OpenCPN/plugins
fork

As mentioned, the changes are pushed to the 'auto' branch by default.
The branch name can be tweaked using the GIT_BRANCH environment variable
in the builder.

If GIT_KEY_PASSWORD or GIT_REPO is missing git-push will not do anything
besides some logging.

== Making the Pull Request (PR) to OpenCPN/plugins

The builders have made commits in the OpenCPN/plugins fork's auto
branch, one for each build. These commits are the metadata files which
work with the plugin installer of the main OpenCPN program. In beta and
production mode they become part of the beta and master catalogs of
plugins in OpenCPN.

=== Syncing master branch

Before making the pull request to OpenCPN/plugins make sure your fork of
this is up to date, and that the remote _upstream_ exists.
https://rick.cogley.info/post/update-your-forked-repository-directly-on-github/[This
guide] has been found useful. Or on the CLI (creating the upstream
remote, the first line, is only required the first time):

....
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins.git
$ git remote update upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase upstream/master
....

=== Master catalog

Adding metadata files from the OpenCPN/plugins fork auto branch to the
master branch goes like this:

....
$ git checkout auto
$ git rebase master
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --squash auto
$ git commit
$ git push
....

The rebase operation should not be strictly necessary, but will pick up
possible errors if the metadata has been changed by other means. The
--squash option lumps the too many commits in the auto branch (one for
each build) to a single one, keeping the master branch tidy.

A PR (pull request) can then be made from the master branch for updating
the master catalog of OpenCPN/plugins.

=== Beta catalog

If you configured for Beta metadata files you need:

....
$ git checkout auto
$ git rebase Beta
$ git checkout Beta
$ git merge --squash auto
$ git commit
$ git push
....

The new TideFinder metadata files have been added to your
OpenCPN/plugins fork Beta branch. A PR, if accepted, results in updating
the Beta catalog of OpenCPN/plugins.

== Security

The private ssh key created by new-credentials is encrypted using a
standard DES alghorithm. There is probably some room to crack this given
the fact that part of ciphertext is known. The encryption would be
stronger if the header and trailer of the key wasn't encrypted.

That said, given the context this should be reasonably safe. At least, a
separate ssh key is used for this purpose, a key which could be easily
revoked.

== Bugs

Probably plenty.
